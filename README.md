# Spaceship Titanic: Data Analytics and Machine Learning Models

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook exploring data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to the Spaceship Titanic dataset.

## Objective

The objective is to gain insights from the Spaceship Titanic dataset and develop machine learning models to predict a target variable, likely passenger survival.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition
- The project utilizes the Spaceship Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle or another source.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to understand the data's characteristics and identify patterns. This includes visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are applied to prepare the data for machine learning models. This involves:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Scaling numerical features

### 4. Machine Learning Modeling
- The project explores various machine learning models suitable for classification tasks, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting

### 5. Model Evaluation
- The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

## Project Outcome

The project aims to uncover valuable insights from the Spaceship Titanic data and identify the most effective machine learning model for predicting the target variable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. The required libraries can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installation
